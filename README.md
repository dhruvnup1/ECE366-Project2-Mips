## Contributions
* README -> Dhruv Upadhyaya. 
* **Fibonacci.asm**
    - Dhruv -> setting up workflow, breaking down the problem into small chunks to simplify the problem. 
    - Aaryan -> coding done on local machine(for fibonacci), testing, verfication of correct outputs.
* **Division.asm**
    - Dhruv -> setting up the workflow, splitting up division and odd, completing division using the repeated subtraction method.
* **Odd.asm**
    - Aaryan -> By using the Division.asm file I was able to determine if the number given is odd. By comparing if the reminder is equal to 0 or 1.  
* **Fibonacci_IsOdd.asm**
    - Aaryan -> By combining all the previous files essentially all I have to do is transfer the output of the Fibonacci to the input of the odd.asm. 
 

## QuickStart Guide:
1. Firstly, open the files in the MIPS editor.
2. Once you do this there will be a **Run** tab at the top bar of the screen.
3. Click **Run** and press the **Assemble** button(F3)
4. Once you do this press **Run** and several options pop up. There is **Go** which runs the entire program execution. There is also **Step** option which allows the viewer to step through the code line by line.
5. To see program output however, simply press **Go** and then all the variables can be viewed in the register view on the right of the screen.
6. The location of where the final value is stored is commented within the code so the viewer can see which register the final answer is stored in.
