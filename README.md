## Contributions
* README -> Dhruv Upadhyaya. 
* **Fibonacci.asm**
    - Dhruv -> setting up workflow, breaking down the problem into small chunks to simplify the problem. 
    - Aaryan -> coding done on local machine(for fibonacci), testing, verfication of correct outputs.
* **Division_and_odd.asm**
    - Dhruv -> setting up workflow, splitting up division and odd, completing division using repeated subtraction method.
    - Aaryan  -> completed isOdd function, implemented division function into isOdd. 
* **Fibonacci_IsOdd.asm**
    - Currently not complete.
 

## QuickStart Guide:
1. Firstly, open the files in the MIPS editor.
2. Once you do this there will be a **Run** tab at the top bar of the screen.
3. Click **Run** and press the **Assemble** button(F3)
4.
